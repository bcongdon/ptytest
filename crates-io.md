The `ptytest` crate provides a convenient way to test programs that write to
terminals, by matching over the state of the pseudo-terminal.

* Under examples, see a simple tested program, and a test that uses `ptytest`'s API
in order to execute and test it.
* See [run-examples.sh](run-examples.sh) file, which builds the example program and runs the example test.
